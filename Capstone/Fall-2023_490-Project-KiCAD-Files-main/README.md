490 Project KiCAD Files

KiCAD doesn't really support git, be careful with your edits.
Try to only push .kd_sch files.

Don't forget to plot/trace your revision in pdf before pushing.

Before merging/rebase to your local branch, check the pdf diagrams for error. 

Don't forget to backup your local branches!

Don't forget to install the ESP32 Library under "/490 Project PCB/CAD Models/ESP32 MCUs/espressif-kicad-addon.zip"
Install it via the KiCAD Package Manager with "Install from File" button.
