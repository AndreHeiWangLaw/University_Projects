# Hydroponics Automated Vertical System

## Objectives:

Our objective is to build a hydroponics vertical system that is automatic and trackable on a custom Android App.

## Project Description:

This project aims to design, develop and build a low-cost vertical hydroponic prototype system that is automated and can monitor critical growing factors through an Android app. The system used will be a combination of Wick System and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) to ensure proper nutrients, irrigation and drainage on both the soil and the root zones. Using this system, all stages of plant growing can be done in the same place: from seeding to harvesting.
Here are some features integrated in the system:
- PH / EC (Electro Conductivity) / T° in water solution is monitored.
- PH / EC / T° in water solution is automatically regulated.
- Humidity and T° in the air is monitored.
- Humidity and T° in the air is automatically regulated.
- Lighting is controlled and monitored.
- Enclosed environment.

All data collected from the different sensors used will be saved in a data base for future user visualization. On the Android App, two pages will be implemented:
- Live Feed: Will show the current data that is being picked up by the sensors.
- Dashboard: Will show graphs/logs of previously collected data from the system.

Finally, this system will be most efficient for urban farming, since it offers high growing capacity in a short time, and  multiple grow cycles a year due to the the controlled environment. All documentations and codes required will be in this repository.
