TLDR definitely does NOT apply in this case)


Hello,

There is a prelab associate with COEN 317 Lab 2. The prelab is meant to provide more information on AXI GPIO ports which are used in the main part
of Lab 2. The prelab and Lab 2 documents are in:

/home/t/ted/PUBLIC/COEN317/Lab2

-rw-r--r-- 1 ted ted    59358 Sep  8  2016 Lab2.pdf
-rw-r--r-- 1 ted ted   294210 Sep  8  2016 Prelab2.pdf

The directory also contains the AXI_GPIO datasheet, the VHDL
code for the AND gate, and a main.cc file used as a template
for the Lab 2 source code.

It is strongly suggested that you read ALL of the lab materials ahead of
each of the 5 labs. You are strongly encouraged to start designing your
systems using XPS, PlanAhead, and SDK ahead of time as much as
possible for each of the 5 labs.

In particular, for Lab 2, you should read and understand the information
found in Prelab2.pdf as it will help you perform Lab 2 .  Although there are
a set of 2 questions at the end of Prelab 2, you are not required to write
the code for these questions nor are you required to design any system
for these questions. 

My apologies to the students in COEN 317 Lab UI who were not informed
of the existence of a prelab for Lab 2 .


And now a word about the dangers of "copy and paste" from a PDF directly
into an ASCCI text source code editor. 

Every year, I hear from COEN 317 students or from the lab TAs about
source code not compiling for no obvious reason. In variable, when asked
the question "did you by any chance copy and paste the C++ code
from the PDF of the lab handout" , the answer is "Yes, I copied and
pasted from the PDF" into the editor pane of SDK (instead of typing it
in the old-fashioned way, or copying some main.cc ASCII text file which
is part of the ~/PUBLIC/COEN317 repository". DO NOT COPY AND
PASTE CODE FROM AC PDF INTO AN ASCII TEXT EDITOR. 

The reason is that PDF saves in Unicode, whereas compiler expect
source code to be in ASCII text format. Unicode uses 2 byes of data for
every character, and ASCII uses 1 byte.  Moreover,  the 2bytes of Unicode for a PDF "smartquote" (it looks different from an ASCII quote if one looks
very carefully at it) are different form the single byte of ASCII text for a ":

ASCII " = 22 hex
PDF " =  e2 89 (hex)

As soon as the PDF " is parsed by the compiler, bang! an weird
compile time error is generated since the #include header file was never
read improperly.

Moralof the story, always type in your source code, and if you have to
copy at least copy from an ASCII text source and not a PDF. 

Regards,

Ted Obuchowicz



TLDR: An acronym popular among the younger generation, when faced with a long online article (anything longer than 140 twitter characters is considered long) , they say "it was TLDR" (it was too long, didn't read it"
LOL, )
