### Assignment for SOEN 341 at Concordia University

The goal of this assignment is to design and develop a procurement system respecting these criterias:
You have been asked to develop a procurement system that automates, as much as possible, material
acquisition of a business. The system allows end users to request the purchase of items which will
result in automatically requesting quotations from suppliers of these items. If the lowest quotation is
less than $5000, the system initiates the purchase. If the lowest quotation is more than $5000, the
system will need at least 2 quotations before submitting the request, with the quotations, to the userâ€™s
supervisor for approval. If approved, the system initiates the purchase. If the request is not approved
by the supervisor, the end user is informed, and the procurement request is then closed.

For the implementation of this system, we decided to consider a library business.
However, this system is general in such way that it can support all types of businesses.
